#eurorack modules

Welcome to my Eurorack module stash. This is a collection of modules I (partially) designed for use with eurorack synthesizers.

## modules

* midi2cv: a midi to cv converter - who could've guessed. 4 Channel 16 bit precision with full 10V pitch range, stm32f373 based
* vca: the MFOS log/linear vca. i never tested this, but it should work. Base-schematic: http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/DUALVCA/DLLVCA001.html
* vca2: a dual exp/lin/log vca, loosely based on the befaco hexmix vca, but only 2 instead of 6.
* stereo_mix: a 4 channel stereo (input AND output) mixer with voltage-controlled panning and volume. Uses the basic circuit from the vca2 intensively. The amount of components is way too high though.
